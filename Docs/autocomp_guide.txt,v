4 Description
    This program generates a composite section and a composite depth scale for matched sediment core data from up to four drill holes. The software package Match 2.0 is suggested for aligning the records. 
    The recommended procedure for creating a composite depth section is to use Match 2.0 to align each hole from a drill site to a “target” hole, which has the greatest percent recovery and/or the greatest depth range. The output files from Match 2.0 can then be used as input files for Autocomp. After Autocomp creates a composite section, Match 2.0 can be used again to match each hole to the composite section for easy conversion from meters below sea floor (mbsf) to meters composite depth (mcd).

6 Software Specifications
  6.1 System Requirements
    This software runs on Matlab version 6 through a custom graphical user interface.
  6.2 Downloading and Running the Software
    Autocomp and Match software is available for download from the “Data & Software” link at http://www.geo.brown.edu/georesearch/esh/paleo.html. To extract the source files, run "gunzip -dc match-2.0.tgz | tar -xvf -".  To run the program type “autocomp” at the Matlab prompt while Matlab current directory is set to the directory containing the downloaded files.
7 Automated Compositing Algorithm
    The software breaks each aligned record into a series of depth segments. For each depth, it includes a segment from one of the aligned records to be included in the composite section. It chooses from which record to take the segment by avoiding record gaps wherever possible and otherwise selecting the segment which is farthest from any core end and, therefore, least likely to be greatly deformed. The segments from the original, unmatched records are used to generate the composite’s depth scale. These segments are placed end-to-end, and the points matched to the core tops of the target record are assigned the core-top depths. The material between target core tops (the series of original segments) is then stretched or compressed by a single factor to fit between the target core tops.
8 Input Files
All output files are in ASCII text.
  8.1 Original signals
    These data files should contain one of the lithologic measurements made on the cores, with depths given in meters below seafloor (mbsf). Each file should consist of three columns. The first (leftmost) column should contain integer core numbers. The next column of the file should contain the depth of the measurement, and the rightmost column is for the lithologic measurements (e.g. reflectance). Even if multiple lithologic characteristics were used to align the holes with the Match software, only one characteristic is used by this program.
  8.2 Matched signals
    The matched signals should be in the format output by the program Match 2.0, but the filenames may be changed. In these files, each hole should be aligned to a chosen “target” hole. The matched signal files have the format of the original input files, but contain a row of “NaN NaN NaN” at core gaps. The Match program outputs matched versions of each record in files with '.new' appended to the original file name (e.g. the matched version of 'signal.dat' will appear as 'signal.dat.new'). After a final match is generated by Match, it may be desirable to rename these “.new” files to prevent overwriting them during future runs of Match. 
  8.3 Match file
    This file contains a “definition” of the produced match. (Match_gui assigns it the same name as the configuration file, but with a “.match” extension instead of “.conf”.) Four columns give the signal core number, the signal depth, the target core number, and the target depth at every position for which the matching speed (i.e. relative sedimentation rate) changes. These points represent the positions of interval matches generated by the program, not actual data points. Data may be converted from one depth/time scale to the other by linear interpolation between the points in the match file. 
9 Output Files
    When the “Save” button is pressed the program writes four files with the name given in the “Composite Section” text box followed by the extensions “.cds”, “.comp”, “.section”, and .”files”. All output files are in ASCII text.
  9.1 Composite Table
    The file with the extension “.section” is a table that contains all of the information necessary to reconstruct the composite section. Each line represents a segment of material from one of the holes and its position in the composite section. The six labeled columns are: hole label, core number, the start and end of the segment in the hole’s mbsf scale, and the start and end of the segment in the new composite depth scale (nmcd). Linear interpolation using the given endpoints will translate each segment from its original mbsf scale to the nmcd scale to create the composite section.
  9.2 Composite section
    The file with the extension “.cds” contains the new composite section. The first column is depth in the new composite depth scale (nmcd) and the second is the lithologic measurement of the segments from the different holes. If the composite section does contain any gaps, they will not be marked in this file. 
  9.3 Configuration file
    The file with the extension “.files” contains the input parameters (i.e. hole labels, filenames, and step size) used in creating the composite section, so that it can be reloaded into Autocomp.
  9.4 Internal file
    The file with the extension “.comp” is a file used by Autocomp to reload a composite section. It contains essentially the same information as the composite table (“.section”). 
  9.5 Composite tie point files
    When a composite is saved, Autocomp also generates tie-point files between each hole and the composite with the extension .mcd.tie (e.g., c846b.mcd.tie). These tie points can be loaded into Match when doing the final alignment between the hole and the composite. Of course, you still need to double check the Match results. If you encounter a problem with the automatically generated tie points, it may indicate a problem with your original inter-hole alignments.
10 Using Autocomp
    The compositing program uses a set of files and one parameter value to generate a composite section.  It runs in Matlab version 6 and is controlled via a user-friendly graphical user interface, from which a user can enter the necessary information, view the output, and make changes if necessary. At the Matlab command prompt, add the directory containing Autocomp to Matlab’s path. The command will be something like “path(path,'c:\cygwin\home\Administrator\Match-2.0\Autocomp')”. Set Matlab’s current directory to the directory that contains your data files. Now to start the program, type “autocomp” at the Matlab prompt. This window will display any warning or error messages that the program generates. As with most programs, it may be wise to save your composite files often in case you accidentally kill the program or lose some of your changes.
  10.1  Getting Started – An example
    A sample composite is included in the Examples directory. First, start Autocomp as described above, setting Matlab’s current directory to the Examples directory. To load the example composite, type “example” in the text box in the upper right of the Autocomp window under the label “Composite Section,” and then click on the button labeled “Load.”  Reflectance data from three holes will appear in the graph on the left, and their composite section will be plotted on the right.
  10.2  Graphs
    The left graph contains plots of the lithologic characteristics from the matched signals. The vertical axis is depth, and the horizontal is the dependent variable with an offset for each hole to reduce overlap. Each signal is plotted in a different shade of black, blue, or green. Hollow circles in the same color as the signal mark the end of each core. Segments selected for inclusion in the composite are highlighted in red, and separated by horizontal dashed lines labeled by numbers. If the “Edit” button is depressed, clicking on these numbers will allow the selected segments to be changed. The scroll bar on the very left of the window allows you to scroll the y-axis of the signal and composite plots.
    The right graph contains a plot of the composite section in its new composite depth scale. Changes to the segments in the left graph will not be propagated to this graph until the “Update” button is pressed. When a new composite section is generated, this graph will remain blank until the “Create” button is pressed.
  10.3  Generating a new composite
    To create a new composite section from scratch, first match each hole at a site to a target hole. The Match 2.0 software is recommended for this task because it generates files in the correct format. The target hole should ideally have the greatest percent recovery and the greatest length. If the longest hole has unacceptably low recovery, the composite can be created in multiple parts with different target holes. The program accepts a minimum of two holes (including the target) and a maximum of four.
    The letter label of each hole should be entered into the top row of text boxes with the target hole on the left. The filenames of corresponding unmatched (mbsf) data should be entered in the second row of text boxes. (Only one lithologic characteristic can be processed at a time in this software, but this does not reduce the accuracy of the procedure if the matched signals were generated from multi-proxy matches.)  The third row of text boxes is for the filenames of all of the signals that have been aligned to the target hole (Match’s “.new” files), and the last row is for the match files that contain the conversions from each hole’s mbsf to the target’s mbsf (default extension, “.match”).
    The step size is the increment by which the software considers the signals. It defaults to 1.0 meter, but this value can be changed by clicking on the text box and entering a new value. All of the segments generated by the program will be multiples of this step size. However, afterwards segments can be adjusted to any size manually. A small step size will tend to create many switches back and forth between holes, and a larger size will tend to result in larger segments but will make it more difficult for the program to avoid gaps and potentially disturbed material.
    When all of the filenames have been entered and the step size is set, press the button labeled “Create.” Plots of the matched signals and the composite will appear. Enter a filename for your composite, and press “Save.”
  10.4  Fine-tuning a composite
    If you are unsatisfied with your automatically generated composite, each segment can be modified individually or you can try creating a new composite with a different step size. The “Edit” button must be depressed in order to manually modify the composite. Changes will not appear in the plot of the composite on the right until the update button is pressed. The depth scale is automatically generated by tying the composite section to the target hole at the target’s core tops. It can only be modified indirectly by changing which hole is selected for each segment.
10.4.1 Changing the minimum segment size
    To change the segment size increment, enter a new value in the text box labeled “Step size.” This parameter is in the same units as the depth scale (generally meters). To generate a new composite section with this increment, press the “Create” button. This will generate new composite segments, so any modifications made to a pre-existing section will be lost. Therefore, you may wish to save any work that you have done before changing the step size.
10.4.2 Merging segments
    To remove an unwanted segment, make sure that the “Edit” button is depressed and type the number found below the horizontal dashed line that forms the upper bound of the segment into the text box labeled “Delete segment #.” The segment will then be merged with the segment above it, with the material from the hole selected in the upper section highlighted.
10.4.3 Splitting segments
    To insert a new segment, make sure that the “Edit” button is depressed and type the number of the segment that you wish to split into the text box labeled “Insert segment after #.” A new horizontal dashed line will appear one step size below the top of the split segment. If the segment is one step size or smaller, the program will generate an error message. However, you may move the lower boundary of that segment to the desired position and insert a segment into the next segment if it is large enough. The new segment will be labeled with a new number but will still have the same hole highlighted. See below to change which hole is highlighted.
10.4.4 Changing segment selection
    For a given segment, the hole from which material is included in the composite is highlighted in red. To change which hole is highlighted make sure that the “Edit” button is depressed and use the mouse cursor to click on the number of the segment that you wish to change. A set of crosshairs will appear. Center the crosshairs over the plot of the new hole that you wish to be highlighted, and click again. The crosshairs will disappear and the red highlighting of that segment will move to the new hole. Do not click on the hole that is already highlighted because that will move the boundary of segment. If you decide not to change which hole is selected while the crosshairs are up, press the “Enter” key to get rid of the crosshairs.
10.4.5 Moving segment boundaries
    To move a segment boundary, check that the “Edit” button is depressed and click on the number directly below the dashed horizontal line you wish to move. The mouse cursor will change into crosshairs. Place the crosshairs at the desired new depth for the segment boundary and click on the right side of the graph where the other numbers appear. You may also click over the plot of the hole that is highlighted (plotted in red) for the segment below the boundary being moved.
10.4.6 Updating the composite
    Changes to the segments in the left graph will not appear in the plot of the composite on the right until the update button is pressed. Be sure that you have updated the composite before saving your work. 
  10.5  Saving and reloading a composite section
    If you made any changes to the automatically generated segments in the graph on the left, press the “Update” button to transfer these changes to the composite. Type a filename to be used for your output files in the textbox labeled “Composite Section” in the upper right, and then press the “Save” button. To reload this data later, type the same filename in the composite section text box and press “Load.” 
  10.6  Converting from mbsf to composite depth
    After Autocomp creates a composite section, Match 2.0 can be used to match each hole to the composite section for easy conversion from meters below sea floor (mbsf) to meters composite depth (mcd). Autocomp automatically generates tie-point files between each hole and the composite with the extension .mcd.tie (e.g., c846b.mcd.tie). These tie points can be loaded into Match when doing the final alignment between the hole and the composite. Of course, you still need to double check the Match results. If you encounter a problem with the generated tie points, it may indicate a problem with your original inter-hole alignments.

6	Software Specifications
  6.1	System Requirements
    This software runs on Matlab version 6 through a custom graphical user interface.
  6.2	Downloading and Running the Software
    Autocomp and Match software is available for download from the "Data & 
Software" link at http://www.geo.brown.edu/georesearch/esh/paleo.html. To extract the 
source files, run "gunzip -dc match-2.0.tgz | tar -xvf -".  To run the program type 
"autocomp" at the Matlab prompt while Matlab current directory is set to the directory 
containing the downloaded files.
7	Automated Compositing Algorithm
    The software breaks each aligned record into a series of depth segments. For each 
depth, it includes a segment from one of the aligned records to be included in the 
composite section. It chooses from which record to take the segment by avoiding record 
gaps wherever possible and otherwise selecting the segment which is farthest from any 
core end and, therefore, least likely to be greatly deformed. The segments from the 
original, unmatched records are used to generate the composite’s depth scale. These 
segments are placed end-to-end, and the points matched to the core tops of the target 
record are assigned the core-top depths. The material between target core tops (the 
series of original segments) is then stretched or compressed by a single factor to fit 
between the target core tops.
8	Input Files
All output files are in ASCII text.
  8.1	Original signals
    These data files should contain one of the lithologic measurements made on the 
cores, with depths given in meters below seafloor (mbsf). Each file should consist of 
three columns. The first (leftmost) column should contain integer core numbers. The 
next column of the file should contain the depth of the measurement, and the rightmost 
column is for the lithologic measurements (e.g. reflectance). Even if multiple lithologic 
characteristics were used to align the holes with the Match software, only one 
characteristic is used by this program.
  8.2	Matched signals
    The matched signals should be in the format output by the program Match 2.0, but 
the filenames may be changed. (Each hole should be aligned to a chosen "target" hole.) 
The matched signal files have the format of the original input files, but contain a row of 
"NaN NaN NaN" at core gaps. The Match program outputs matched versions of each 
record in files with '.new' appended to the original file name (e.g. the matched version 
of 'signal.dat' will appear as 'signal.dat.new'). After a final match is generated by 
Match, it may be desirable to rename these ".new" files to prevent overwriting them 
during future runs of Match. 
  8.3	Match file
    This file contains a "definition" of the produced match. (Match_gui assigns it the 
same name as the configuration file, but with a ".match" extension instead of ".conf".) 
Four columns give the signal core number, the signal depth, the target core number, and 
the target depth at every position for which the matching speed (i.e. relative 
sedimentation rate) changes. These points represent the positions of interval matches 
generated by the program, not actual data points. Data may be converted from one 
depth/time scale to the other by linear interpolation between the points in the match file. 
9	Output Files
    When the "Save" button is pressed the program writes four files with the name given 
in the "Composite Section" text box followed by the extensions ".cds", ".comp", 
".section", and ."files". All output files are in ASCII text.
  9.1	Composite Table
    The file with the extension ".section" is a table that contains all of the information 
necessary to reconstruct the composite section. Each line represents a segment of 
material from one of the holes and its position in the composite section. The six labeled 
columns are: hole label, core number, the start and end of the segment in the hole’s 
mbsf scale, and the start and end of the segment in the new composite depth scale 
(nmcd). Linear interpolation using the given endpoints will translate each segment from 
its original mbsf scale to the nmcd scale to create the composite section.
  9.2	Composite section
    The file with the extension ".cds" contains the new composite section. The first 
column is depth in the new composite depth scale (nmcd) and the second is the 
lithologic measurement of the segments from the different holes. If the composite 
section does contain any gaps, they will not be marked in this file. 
  9.3	Configuration file
    The file with the extension ".files" contains the input parameters (i.e. hole labels, 
filenames, and step size) used in creating the composite section, so that it can be 
reloaded into Autocomp.
  9.4	Internal file
    The file with the extension ".comp" is a file used by Autocomp to reload a 
composite section. It contains essentially the same information as the composite table 
(".section"). 
10	Using Autocomp
    The compositing program uses a set of files and one parameter value to generate a 
composite section.  It runs in Matlab version 6 and is controlled via a user-friendly 
graphical user interface, from which a user can enter the necessary information, view the 
output, and make changes if necessary. At the Matlab command prompt, add the 
directory containing Autocomp to Matlab’s path. The command will be something like 
"path(path,'c:\cygwin\home\Administrator\Match-2.0\Autocomp')". Set Matlab’s current 
directory to the directory that contains your data files. Now to start the program, type 
"autocomp" at the Matlab prompt. This window will display any warning or error 
messages that the program generates. As with most programs, it may be wise to save your 
composite files often in case you accidentally kill the program or lose some of your 
changes.
  10.1	 Getting Started – An example
    A sample composite is included in the Examples directory. First, start Autocomp as 
described above, setting Matlab’s current directory to the Examples directory. To load 
the example composite, type "example" in the text box in the upper right of the 
Autocomp window under the label "Composite Section," and then click on the button 
labeled "Load."  Reflectance data from three holes will appear in the graph on the left, 
and their composite section will be plotted on the right.
  10.2	 Graphs
    The left graph contains plots of the lithologic characteristics from the matched 
signals. The vertical axis is depth, and the horizontal is the dependent variable with an 
offset for each hole to reduce overlap. Each signal is plotted in a different shade of 
black, blue, or green. Hollow circles in the same color as the signal mark the end of 
each core. Segments selected for inclusion in the composite are highlighted in red, and 
separated by horizontal dashed lines labeled by numbers. If the "Edit" button is 
depressed, clicking on these numbers will allow the selected segments to be changed. 
The scroll bar on the very left of the window allows you to scroll the y-axis of the 
signal and composite plots.
    The right graph contains a plot of the composite section in its new composite depth 
scale. Changes to the segments in the left graph will not be propagated to this graph 
until the "Update" button is pressed. When a new composite section is generated, this 
graph will remain blank until the "Create" button is pressed.
  10.3	 Generating a new composite
    To create a new composite section from scratch, first match each hole at a site to a 
target hole. The Match 2.0 software is recommended for this task because it generates 
files in the correct format. The target hole should ideally have the greatest percent 
recovery and the greatest length. If the longest hole has unacceptably low recovery, the 
composite can be created in multiple parts with different target holes. The program 
accepts a minimum of two holes (including the target) and a maximum of four.
    The letter label of each hole should be entered into the top row of text boxes with 
the target hole on the left. The filenames of corresponding unmatched (mbsf) data 
should be entered in the second row of text boxes. (Only one lithologic characteristic 
can be processed at a time in this software, but this does not reduce the accuracy of the 
procedure if the matched signals were generated from multi-proxy matches.)  The third 
row of text boxes is for the filenames of all of the signals that have been aligned to the 
target hole (Match’s ".new" files), and the last row is for the match files that contain the 
conversions from each hole’s mbsf to the target’s mbsf (default extension, ".match").
    The step size is the increment by which the software considers the signals. It 
defaults to 1.0 meter, but this value can be changed by clicking on the text box and 
entering a new value. All of the segments generated by the program will be multiples of 
this step size. However, afterwards segments can be adjusted to any size manually. A 
small step size will tend to create many switches back and forth between holes, and a 
larger size will tend to result in larger segments but will make it more difficult for the 
program to avoid gaps and potentially disturbed material.
    When all of the filenames have been entered and the step size is set, press the button 
labeled "Create." Plots of the matched signals and the composite will appear. Enter a 
filename for your composite, and press "Save."
  10.4	 Fine-tuning a composite
    If you are unsatisfied with your automatically generated composite, each segment 
can be modified individually or you can try creating a new composite with a different 
step size. The "Edit" button must be depressed in order to manually modify the 
composite. Changes will not appear in the plot of the composite on the right until the 
update button is pressed. The depth scale is automatically generated by tying the 
composite section to the target hole at the target’s core tops. It can only be modified 
indirectly by changing which hole is selected for each segment.
10.4.1 Changing the minimum segment size
    To change the segment size increment, enter a new value in the text box labeled 
"Step size." This parameter is in the same units as the depth scale (generally meters). 
To generate a new composite section with this increment, press the "Create" button. 
This will generate new composite segments, so any modifications made to a pre-
existing section will be lost. Therefore, you may wish to save any work that you have 
done before changing the step size.
10.4.2 Merging segments
    To remove an unwanted segment, make sure that the "Edit" button is depressed 
and type the number found below the horizontal dashed line that forms the upper 
bound of the segment into the text box labeled "Delete segment #." The segment will 
then be merged with the segment above it, with the material from the hole selected in 
the upper section highlighted.
10.4.3 Splitting segments
    To insert a new segment, make sure that the "Edit" button is depressed and type 
the number of the segment that you wish to split into the text box labeled "Insert 
segment after #." A new horizontal dashed line will appear one step size below the 
top of the split segment. If the segment is one step size or smaller, the program will 
generate an error message. However, you may move the lower boundary of that 
segment to the desired position and insert a segment into the next segment if it is 
large enough. The new segment will be labeled with a new number but will still have 
the same hole highlighted. See below to change which hole is highlighted.
10.4.4 Changing segment selection
    For a given segment, the hole from which material is included in the composite is 
highlighted in red. To change which hole is highlighted make sure that the "Edit" 
button is depressed and use the mouse cursor to click on the number of the segment 
that you wish to change. A set of crosshairs will appear. Center the crosshairs over 
the plot of the new hole that you wish to be highlighted, and click again. The 
crosshairs will disappear and the red highlighting of that segment will move to the 
new hole. Do not click on the hole that is already highlighted because that will move 
the boundary of segment. If you decide not to change which hole is selected while the 
crosshairs are up, press the "Enter" key to get rid of the crosshairs.
10.4.5 Moving segment boundaries
    To move a segment boundary, check that the "Edit" button is depressed and click 
on the number directly below the dashed horizontal line you wish to move. The 
mouse cursor will change into crosshairs. Place the crosshairs at the desired new 
depth for the segment boundary and click on the right side of the graph where the 
other numbers appear. You may also click over the plot of the hole that is highlighted 
(plotted in red) for the segment below the boundary being moved.
10.4.6 Updating the composite
    Changes to the segments in the left graph will not appear in the plot of the 
composite on the right until the update button is pressed. Be sure that you have 
updated the composite before saving your work. 
  10.5	 Saving and reloading a composite section
    If you made any changes to the automatically generated segments in the graph on 
the left, press the "Update" button to transfer these changes to the composite. Type a 
filename to be used for your output files in the textbox labeled "Composite Section" in 
the upper right, and then press the "Save" button. To reload this data later, type the 
same filename in the composite section text box and press "Load."
